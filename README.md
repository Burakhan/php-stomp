CentralDesktop STOMP Library.

Includes partial 1.1 support, circular buffers, XML maps (in addition to JSON) and a whole host of fixes and improvements to the fusesource.org code base from which we worked some years ago.

To test:

composer install (or composer update)

Tests don't use mocks, they use an actual service (yes, that means these aren't actually tests)
